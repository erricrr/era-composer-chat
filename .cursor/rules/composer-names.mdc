Composers listed must always be in alphabetical order. NOTE:
1) There will be composers with the same Last name that needs to be ordered according to the first letter in their first name,
2) THERE may also be composers with the same last name AND the same first letter in their first name that will need to be ordered by the SECOND letter in their first name.

Last name filtering refinement for "de" and hyphenated last names must be accurate, for example names like:
- "Elisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre"
- "Chevalier de Saint-Georges"
- "Samuel Coleridge-Taylor"

Special case for Ludwig van Beethoven to ensure correct person. Use exact title match to avoid getting "Ludwig van Beethoven the Elder".
